# Labor Tracker Special Instructions

In this document, we discuss how to view the Labor Tracker application so that it can be graded. Since the Labor Tracker is a Web application that is deployed publicly, these instructions are very simple.

## Getting to the Website

Open up [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Other browsers likely work as well, but we targeted chrome during development. Then, direct your browser to the following page: [thelabortracker.com](https://thelabortracker.com/). You should then be able to login to the app using Google sign-in (which requires a Google account).

If you have trouble performing any of the functions on the website, then please refer to the [Manual](https://github.gatech.edu/gt-hit-spring2018/Labor-Tracker/blob/master/Final%20Delivery/Manual%20-%20Cloud%20Regency.pdf).
