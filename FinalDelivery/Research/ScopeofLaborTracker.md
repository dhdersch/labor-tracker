#### Primary Source 
Primary Research for the project included interview and discussion with our external mentor Nicole Carson.

#### Scope 
The scope of Labor Tracker is to help women track their labor based on her cervical dilation. It involves the creation of BMI individualized partograms that allow clinicians to view women's cervical dilation progress on a graph. The graph would represent normal and abnormal progression according to women's BMI. The main aim of the Labor Tracker is going to be reducing the mortality rates among obese women as they are more likely to have elevated risk for cesarean delivery.

#### Usefulness 
According to Nicole:
>A tool like the Labor Tracker would be useful to both healthcare providers and to pregnant women. For providers, the tracker would provide evidence-based, real-time feedback on the adequacy of labor progress by a woman's BMI. Currently, major interventions like cesarean delivery are decided by providers based on labor progress guidelines that are not individualized for a particular patient.  This practice is not supported by the newest research, and results in many unnecessary surgical births with poorer outcomes for both women and their newborns.  For pregnant women, the Labor Tracker would allow her to be better engaged with her labor progress and participate more fully with her healthcare provider in making informed decisions about her labor care.  The app would also possibly decrease her likelihood of ending labor with an unnecessary cesarean birth, thereby improving outcomes for both herself and her baby.
